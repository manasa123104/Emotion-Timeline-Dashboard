1)I’m furious that you betrayed me,  
but I can’t deny I miss our laughter.  
Sometimes I feel jealous, sometimes I feel lost.  
Yet, there’s still a part of me that wants to forgive.  
Maybe one day, we will find peace again.

3) Your smile lights up my darkest days.  
I feel grateful for every moment we share.  
Love makes me strong, and joy dances in my heart.  
Even the simplest touch brings comfort and peace.  
I cherish this bond more than words can say.


4) The room feels empty without your voice.  
Loneliness wraps around me like a cold blanket.  
Tears fall quietly, unseen by anyone.  
I wonder if happiness will ever return.  
Still, I carry the memory of your warmth.


5) I’m nervous but also excited for what lies ahead.  
Doubt whispers in my mind, yet curiosity keeps me moving.  
Every failure surprises me, every success fills me with pride.  
Sometimes I feel lost, but sometimes I feel unstoppable.  
This journey is confusing, but it’s mine to embrace.
