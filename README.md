# Emotion-Timeline-Dashboard
Emotional Timeline Dashboard is a Streamlit app that analyzes scripts, lyrics, or text with Hugging Face GoEmotions. It visualizes 28 emotions across segments as an interactive timeline, showing how joy, anger, sadness, and more evolve through a story.

The app offers two input modes:

‚úçÔ∏è Paste Text ‚Äì For short scripts, dialogues, or lyrics

üìÇ Upload TXT File ‚Äì For longer documents or collections

Users can customize segmentation (by sentences or word count) and apply smoothing to reduce noise. Clear visualizations include multi-line emotion timelines, top-k emotion distributions, and average emotion scores. Results can also be exported as CSV for deeper analysis.

This project demonstrates the fusion of state-of-the-art NLP and data visualization, showing how machine learning can provide insights into creative and cultural domains. Potential use cases include analyzing screenplays, studying albums for mood progression, or assisting writers in tracking emotional impact.

The dashboard is a practical yet creative project that highlights technical skills, interactive design, and the power of modern NLP to enhance storytelling and research.
